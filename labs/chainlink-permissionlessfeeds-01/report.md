# Chainlink — PermissionlessFeedsConsumer onReport() (Unauthenticated Call)
Author: Sidney R. Swayzer (“mrfrost23”) • Date: 2025-09-05

## Summary
Evidence for a report where `onReport()` appears callable without proper authorization, enabling arbitrary mutation of `s_feedReports`. This folder preserves artifacts/screenshots; PoC should be implemented as a Forge test against a local fork.

## Evidence Pack
All files preserved under `evidence/`. Images duplicated in `images/` for quick viewing.

## Reproduction Plan (lab/testnet only)
- Validate access control on report ingestion.
- Model expected caller (authorized oracle/transmitter contract).
- Demonstrate state mutation from an unauthorized EOA/contract in a test.
- Provide mitigation: add access control + input validation.

## Proof of Concept (to add)
- Place Forge tests under `test/`.- Include commands to run (e.g., `forge test -vvv --match-test test_exploit`).- Attach minimal logs/assertions that prove impact without touching production systems.

## Ethics & Scope
Performed under **ROE** in `opsec/ROE.md`. No production systems are targeted. Any on-chain interactions must use **local forks/testnets** only.
