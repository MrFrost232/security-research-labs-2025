# CDCETH Smart Contract — Integer Overflow (Evidence)
Author: Sidney R. Swayzer (“mrfrost23”) • Date: 2025-09-05

## Summary
Screenshots/evidence related to a suspected arithmetic overflow/underflow condition in the CDCETH smart contract (Crypto.com). Evidence is preserved for analysis; reproduction must occur on a local fork or testnet only.

## Evidence Pack
All files preserved under `evidence/`. Images duplicated in `images/` for quick viewing.

## Reproduction Plan (lab/testnet only)
- Investigate arithmetic operations around mint/burn/exchange paths.
- Check proxy/implementation separation and initializer status.
- Confirm compiler version, SafeMath usage (if <0.8), and unchecked blocks.
- Reproduce only on a local mainnet fork; never touch production.

## Proof of Concept (to add)
- Place Forge tests under `test/`.- Include commands to run (e.g., `forge test -vvv --match-test test_exploit`).- Attach minimal logs/assertions that prove impact without touching production systems.

## Ethics & Scope
Performed under **ROE** in `opsec/ROE.md`. No production systems are targeted. Any on-chain interactions must use **local forks/testnets** only.
