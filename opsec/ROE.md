# Rules of Engagement (ROE)

- I only test systems I **own** or have **written permission** to test.
- **Testnets/local forks** only for blockchain targets.
- **Stop on impact**: no user data, no availability harm.
- Keep a **paper trail** (timestamps, notes, commits) to show good-faith research.
- Responsible disclosure only; coordinate fixes before any publication.
