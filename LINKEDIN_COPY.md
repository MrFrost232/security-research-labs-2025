Security Researcher â€” Web & Smart Contracts | CVE | Fuzzing (AFL++) | Foundry PoCs | AWS

## About
Iâ€™m a security researcher focused on web and smart-contract vulnerabilities. I build fuzzing and Foundry harnesses to turn issues into reproducible PoCs with root-cause analysis and fixes. Highlights: CVE credit in crypto library code, high-signal labs (web & EVM), and a report-first workflow that ships mitigation guidance. Portfolio: add your GitHub repo link here.

## Experience (Independent â€” 2024â€“Present)
- Shipped **CVE-2025-54600** (libsodium ChaCha20 AEAD decrypt) with sanitizer-backed fuzzing, crash triage, and mitigation notes.
- Built **Foundry** test suites that convert findings into reproducible PoCs with clear assertions and impact.
- Reported issues to **Chainlink** (#3273684) and **Fireblocks** (#3272102); maintained strict **ROE** (testnets/local forks, stop-on-impact).
- Focus areas: web app security, smart-contract auditing (EVM/NEAR), cryptographic implementation pitfalls.
- Published PoC-first labs and write-ups: link to your GitHub `security-research-labs-2025` repo.

## Projects
- **Security Research Labs 2025** â€” PoC-driven reports and tests (web + EVM). Link to your GitHub repo.
- **Fuzzing Harnesses (AFL++/ASan/UBSan)** â€” Crash-to-PoC pipeline; minimization and backtrace workflows.

## Publications
